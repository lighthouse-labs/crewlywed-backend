The newlywed game for you and your "crew"! Test your knowledge of your crew with this live browser-based game!  A live updating interactive React based game. Users are able to join different game rooms in order to play with their friends.

### <ins> Rules <ins/>

Everyone joins a game room and the game begins.

Each round poses a question about one of the players, who is the designated "victim" for that round -- for example, "How would ____ survive the apocalypse?" Then every player submits an answer.

Next, all submissions are displayed and all players except the victim have to select which one they think was submitted by the victim.

Points are won by (i) guessing the victim's answer and (ii) fooling others into guessing your answer.
